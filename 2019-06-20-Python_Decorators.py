def hi(name="yasoob"):
    return "hi " + name

print(hi())
# output: 'hi yasoob'

# We can even assign a function to a variable like
greet = hi
# We are not using parentheses here because we are not calling the function hi
# instead we are just putting it into the greet variable. Let's try to run this

print(greet())
# output: 'hi yasoob'

# Let's see what happens if we delete the old hi function!
#del hi
#print(hi())
#outputs: NameError

#outputs: 'hi yasoob'

#output:now you are inside the hi() function
#       now you are in the greet() function
#       now you are in the welcome() function
#       now you are back in the hi() function

# This shows that whenever you call hi(), greet() and welcome()
# are also called. However the greet() and welcome() functions
# are not available outside the hi() function e.g:

#greet()
#outputs: NameError: name 'greet' is not defined
#
#
# returning functions from other functions
